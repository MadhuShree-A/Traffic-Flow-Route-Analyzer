# Traffic-Flow-Route-Analyzer
Traffic Flow &amp; Route Analyzer

A real-time traffic monitoring and prediction app built with **Streamlit**, leveraging **TomTom APIs**, **LSTM models**, and interactive maps using **Folium**. It analyzes current traffic between two locations, simulates historical patterns, predicts congestion levels using deep learning, and visualizes optimal routes.


##  Features

- Get real-time traffic data using **TomTom Traffic API**
- Simulate and visualize historical traffic congestion
- Predict future congestion using an **LSTM neural network**
- Display route alternatives on an interactive **Folium map**
- Beautiful charts with **Plotly**



## Powered By

- **Streamlit** – for the web interface
- **TensorFlow + Keras** – for LSTM traffic prediction
- **TomTom API** – for live traffic and route data
- **Folium** – for interactive mapping
- **Plotly** – for visual analytics

## Run the App

- streamlit run trafficAnalyzer.py
